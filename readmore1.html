        <h2>What did Kafka mean by saying "Please, consider me a dream"?</h2>
        <p><i>Those words were spoken by Franz Kafka to the father of his lifelong friend Max Brod. (Baumer, pg. 2) Within that sentence, the entire theme of Kafka's life is summed up. A lonely man who was terrified to reach the summit of his creative potential, Kafka was forced to instead spend most of his adult life stifling his passion to write. Perpetually trapped in a cage of low self-esteem, Kafka had to battle his father, his Jewish ancestry, and his own self-doubts. Extremely introverted, Kafka felt a need to hide his inner true person, and instead mask it with something that society would accept. Using writing as an escape valve for his soul, such works as “The Metamorphosis” and The Trial metaphorically provide a window to this hidden person. Kafka also revealed this part of himself to trusted friends like Max Brod, and his love of five years, Felice Bauer. For the most part, however, Kafka was a dual person of sorts: Franz the accepted employee of an insurance company who nicely fit the demands he felt from his social environment, and Franz the cursed writer trapped in a “dreamworld” whose work was never to be fully appreciated in his lifetime.</i></p>
